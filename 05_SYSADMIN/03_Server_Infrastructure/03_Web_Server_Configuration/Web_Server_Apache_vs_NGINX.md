      <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Apache is a robust, feature-rich web server designed primarily
          for serving dynamic content and extensive customization. It uses
          Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) to handle requests. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/overview.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>NGINX is a high-performance web server designed for speed and scalability,
          primarily to handle high-concurrency, static content, and reverse
          proxying. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Features</td>
        <td>Supports dynamic content via modules, MPMs, .htaccess configuration,
          extensive logging, and URL rewriting. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/worker.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>Efficient event-driven architecture, reverse proxy, load balancing,
          SSL termination, and handling of static content. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/nginx-features/"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Static content</td>
        <td>Good at serving static content, but can be slower compared to NGINX
          due to its process-based architecture. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/faq/best_practices.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>Excellent at serving static content due to its event-driven architecture,
          which efficiently handles multiple requests. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/static-content/"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dynamic content</td>
        <td>Handles dynamic content well through its support for various modules
          and integration with backend languages. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/cgi.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>Less efficient for dynamic content handling directly; typically
          used as a reverse proxy to pass requests to application servers.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Combined Use</td>
        <td>Apache and NGINX can be used together with NGINX as a reverse proxy
          and load balancer, handling static content and forwarding dynamic
          content requests to Apache. This setup improves performance,
          scalability, and security. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-as-a-reverse-proxy"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>NGINX is often used as the front-end server for handling static
          content and SSL termination, while Apache serves dynamic content.
          This combination leverages NGINX's performance and Apache's flexibility.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance</td>
        <td>Generally lower performance under high load due to its process-based
          model, which can lead to higher memory usage. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/performance_tuning.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>High performance with lower memory usage due to its event-driven,
          asynchronous model, which scales well with increased traffic.

          configured to handle DDoS and brute force attacks. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/misc/security_tips.html"
          target="_blank">(More)</a></td>
        <td>Good security features, including built-in mechanisms to mitigate
          DDoS and brute force attacks, though generally considered less
          customizable compared to Apache. <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx-security/"
