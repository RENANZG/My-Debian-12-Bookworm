<h2>Comparison of Steganography and Watermarking</h2>

<table>

        <th>Aspect</th>
        <th>Steganography</th>
        <th>Watermarking</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Conceals data within other data or media.</td>
        <td>Embeds a watermark to verify data integrity or ownership.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Primary Purpose</td>
        <td>Covert communication; Data presence is hidden.</td>
        <td>Data integrity verification; Ownership protection.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Methodology</td>
        <td>Covert data embedding using various algorithms (LSB, DCT, etc.).</td>
        <td>Embedded data integrity using techniques like spread spectrum, quantization index modulation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Detection</td>
        <td>Designed to be undetectable; Vulnerable to advanced detection techniques.</td>
        <td>Designed to be detectable; Watermark must be robust against tampering.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Capacity</td>
        <td>Limited data capacity, depending on the cover medium and method used.</td>
        <td>Typically low data capacity; Focus is on robustness rather than capacity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Applications</td>
        <td>Secure communication, covert channel creation, anti-censorship.</td>
        <td>Copyright protection, content authentication, tamper detection.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Key Advantage</td>
        <td>Data presence is hidden, allowing covert communication.</td>
        <td>Ensures data integrity and ownership, supports forensic analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Key Disadvantage</td>
        <td>Vulnerable to detection; Limited by data capacity of cover medium.</td>
        <td>Can be altered or removed if not robust; Lower data capacity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Forensic Relevance</td>
        <td>Useful in digital forensics for uncovering hidden communications.</td>
        <td>Crucial for verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital evidence.</td>
