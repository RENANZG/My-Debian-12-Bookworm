    <td colspan="2" rowspan="4">Public Key <br>Cryptography (PKC)</td>
    <td>RSA</td>
    <td>Widely used for secure data transmission. Based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.</td>

    <td>DSA</td>
    <td>Used for digital signatures. Based on the mathematical problem of discrete logarithms.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>ECC</td>
    <td>Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Offers similar security to RSA with shorter key lengths, based on elliptic curve theory.</td>
