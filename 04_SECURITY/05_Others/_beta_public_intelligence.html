  <h1>Public Intelligence</h1>

  <h2>1. Operational Security (OpSec)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cover Identities:</strong> Operatives maintain cover identities that
      are thoroughly constructed and backed by appropriate documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication Security:</strong> Use encrypted communication channels
      and regularly change communication methods to avoid detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Operatives are trained in surveillance detection
      and conduct regular counter-surveillance to identify potential threats.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Meetings:</strong> Arrange meetings in secure locations and vary
      meeting times and patterns to avoid establishing predictable routines.</li>
    Always test cover identities by passing through controlled environments, such as
    airports or border crossings, to ensure their credibility. </ul>

  <h2>2. Counter-Surveillance</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Behavioral Awareness:</strong> Operatives are trained to recognize surveillance
      tactics and behaviors.</li>
    <li><strong>Surveillance Detection:</strong> Conduct surveillance detection routes
      (SDRs) to identify and evade surveillance.</li>
    <li><strong>Use of Disguises:</strong> Utilize disguises and alter appearances to
      evade surveillance.</li> Change appearance by altering hairstyle, clothing,
    or posture, and avoid drawing attention with unusual or extravagant disguises.
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information Security</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Need-to-Know Basis:</strong> Operatives strictly adhere to the principle
      of sharing information only on a need-to-know basis.</li>
    <li><strong>Compartmentalization:</strong> Information is compartmentalized to limit
      exposure in case of compromise.</li>
    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Use strong encryption for sensitive communications
      and data storage.</li> Use two-factor authentication (2FA) on all critical
    accounts and devices to further secure sensitive information. </ul>

  <h2>4. Counter-Intelligence Awareness</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Threats:</strong> Operatives are trained to recognize signs
      of surveillance or potential compromise.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Security Briefings:</strong> Stay updated on counter-intelligence
      tactics and methods used by adversaries.</li> Keep up with the latest in adversarial
    methods by monitoring news, intelligence reports, and technological advancements
    in counter-surveillance. </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal and Psychological Resilience</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legal Knowledge:</strong> Understand the legal consequences of espionage
      and have contingency plans in place.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological Resilience:</strong> Operatives undergo psychological training
      to handle stress and pressure.</li> Regular mental health check-ins and stress
    management techniques can help maintain psychological resilience in high-pressure
    situations. </ul>

  <h2>6. Support Network</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Handler Communication:</strong> Maintain secure communication with handlers
      for guidance and support.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency Extraction Plans:</strong> Have contingency plans and resources
      in place for emergency extraction if compromised.</li> Pre-arrange safe houses
    and escape routes in multiple locations to ensure smooth emergency extraction
    under varying conditions. </ul>

  <h2>7. Adaptability and Flexibility</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adapt to Circumstances:</strong> Be prepared to adapt operational plans
      and methods based on changing circumstances and intelligence.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate Risk vs. Reward:</strong> Continually assess the risk versus
      the potential intelligence gain of operations.</li> Create detailed risk assessments
    before each mission to ensure quick decision-making when situations change unexpectedly.
    </ul>
