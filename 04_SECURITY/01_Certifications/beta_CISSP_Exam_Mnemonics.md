  <h1>CISSP Exam Mnemonics</h1>

  <h2>1. OSI Model and Networking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OSI Model: Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pet Alligator (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application)</li>
    <li>Data at Each Stage of OSI Layer: Don't Don't Don't Stop Pouring Free Beer (Data, Data, Data, Segment, Packet, Frame, Bits)</li>
    <li>TCP/IP Layers: NITA (Network, Internet, Transport, Application)</li>
    <li>RAID 0: Striping - 0 looks like a circle, like going in circles, leaving data everywhere.</li>
    <li>RAID 1: Mirroring - 1 or | looks like a mirror.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Cryptography</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Asymmetric Cryptography: DEREK (Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, RSA, ECC, Knapsack)</li>
    <li>Symmetric Cryptography: 23BRAIDS (Twofish, 3DES, Blowfish, RC5, AES, IDEA, DES, SAFER)</li>
    <li>SkipJack: SkipJack has 8 letters = 80-bit key size.</li>
    <li>Blowfish: The fish "blows" bigger, so the key size starts at 32 but can "blow" up to 448 bits.</li>
    <li>Twofish: Think of "whitening" fish teeth — Twofish uses whitening in its process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Security Models</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL): Father Son Mother My Sweet Small Family (Functionally Tested, Structurally Tested, Methodically tested and checked, Methodically designed, tested, and reviewed, Semi-formally designed and tested, Semi-formally designed, verified and tested, Formally designed, verified and tested)</li>
    <li>MAC (Mandatory Access Control): The "Lattice Model" is like a Big Mac with Lettuce.</li>
    <li>Biba Model: The "I" in Biba stands for **Integrity**.</li>
    <li>Bell-LaPadula: Bell, LA PA DU LA - CON FI DEN SHI AL IT E (focuses on Confidentiality).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Risk Management and Incident Response</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Risk Formula: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability (RISK TV)</li>
    <li>ALE Formula: ALE = ARO x SLE (Annual Loss Expectancy = Annualized Rate of Occurrence × Single Loss Expectancy)</li>
    <li>Incident Response: Drumroll (DRMRRRL - Detect, Response, Mitigate, Report, Recover, Remediate, Lessons Learned)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Business Continuity Planning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>NIST 800-37 Risk Management Framework: People Can See I Am Always Monitoring (Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor)</li>
    <li>BCP Phases: Project Scope & Planning, BIA (Identifying Priorities, Risk Identification, Likelihood Assessment, etc.), Strategy Development, Plan Approval and Implementation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Destruction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Sanitization (COWPIGSOW): Clearing Can be recovered (Deleting), Purging is Permanent, Sanitizing is Same as Purging, Overwriting with 0s and 1s, Wiping is Writing (overwriting again).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Fire Extinguishers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Classifications: A = Ashes (wood, paper), B = Boil (liquids like gasoline), C = Electri C ity (electrical fires), D = Dent (metals), K = Kitchen (oil/grease).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Patent = 20 years: Notice the word "ten" in Patent. It fits better into 20 (not 70 like copyright).</li>
    <li>Trademark = 10 years: Easy to remember, similar to patents but shorter.</li>
    <li>USPTO: United States Patents and Trademark Office (Library of Congress handles copyright).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Software Development & Testing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Software Capability Maturity Model: I Really Don't Mind Oreos (Initiating, Repeatable, Defined, Managed, Optimized).</li>
    <li>Change Management Process: Red Rabbits Are Trained In Dancing (Request, Review, Accept/Reject, Testing, Implement, Document).</li>
    <li>SDLC Phases: RDITE (Real Developers Ideas Take Effort — Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Evolution).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Threat Modeling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.</li>
    <li>DREAD: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability.</li>
  </ul>
