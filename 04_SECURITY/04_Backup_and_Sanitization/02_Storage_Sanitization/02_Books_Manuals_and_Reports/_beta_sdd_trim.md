  <p>Not all SSDs support sanitize, but enabling TRIM in your BIOS boosts performance, longevity, and anti-forensics. TRIM lets the OS inform the SSD of unused blocks, allowing internal wiping and reducing wear. Over-provisioning increases available space for better data management, enhancing both performance and durability. However, care is needed to avoid SSD flaws and ensure optimal over-provisioning.</p>
  
  <p><b>The crypttab man page warns that enabling the discard option on encrypted devices can potentially leak information about the encrypted data.</b> This happens because SSD firmware may zero out unused blocks, making them identifiable and revealing patterns such as the filesystem type and used space. An attacker could use this minimal information to target smaller portions of encrypted data and potentially assist in breaking the encryption. However, the actual risk is unclear, as the leak may only offer limited help to an attacker. The warning advises disabling discard (or TRIM) to avoid such risks, especially if there's a need to prevent the exposure of unused sectors or hidden data. Once TRIM is executed, the discarded sectors remain detectable, and encrypted devices should avoid relying on functions that return zeroed-out sectors. To minimize risks, sensitive directories like /tmp /var and other directories used by encryption should be kept in memory and cleared at shutdown.</p>
