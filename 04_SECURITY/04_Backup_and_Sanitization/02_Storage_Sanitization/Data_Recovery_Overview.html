        <td><strong>Data Wiping</strong></td>
        <td>Overwriting files to make data recovery difficult or impossible.</td>
        <td>Eraser, DBAN</td>
        <td>Wiping can thwart standard recovery tools, but forensic tools like Autopsy may still detect metadata or partial traces.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>File Signature Manipulation</strong></td>
        <td>Changing a file’s header signature to hide its real type or content.</td>
        <td>WinHEX</td>
        <td>Autopsy and similar tools can detect mismatches between the file extension and the actual signature.</td>

        <td><strong>File Slack Hiding</strong></td>
        <td>Embedding hidden data within the slack space of files.</td>

        <td>7</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Gutmann Method (35 Passes)</strong></td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>Overwrites data 35 times with different patterns to prevent recovery.</td>
        <td>Excessive for modern drives, but effective against older magnetic storage. Less effective on SSDs due to TRIM and wear leveling.</td>
      </tr>

        <td><strong>Pseudorandom Data</strong></td>
        <td>1</td>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Wear Leveling</strong></td>
        <td>Not applicable</td>
        <td>Distributes writes across cells, making secure deletion difficult as data can reside in multiple locations.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>TRIM Command</strong></td>
        <td>Not applicable</td>
        <td>Improves SSD performance by marking blocks as free, but complicates recovery as data blocks are removed from logical visibility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Fragmentation</strong></td>
        <td>HDDs suffer from file fragmentation over time, which can affect recovery efforts.</td>
        <td>Wear leveling and TRIM create internal fragmentation, complicating recovery.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Encryption</strong></td>
        <td>Often relies on software-based encryption like BitLocker or VeraCrypt.</td>
        <td>Hardware encryption is common, but software-based methods like BitLocker are also supported.</td>
