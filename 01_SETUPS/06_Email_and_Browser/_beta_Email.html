        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Adding a "+" character after the username portion of your email address (e.g., work+tag@example.com) to create unique aliases for each contact or site.</td>
        <td>Third-party services that create anonymous forwarding email addresses, which forward emails to your real address without revealing it.</td>
        <td>Temporary, disposable email addresses that expire after a short period, ideal for one-time use.</td>
        <td>Using a main email address with many unique aliases that forward to it (e.g., support@domain.com, shopping@domain.com). Each alias can be disposed of independently.</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Requires relying on third-party services for security.Some services may have limitations or fees for full functionality.</td>
        <td>Not suitable for ongoing communications or long-term engagement.Emails expire quickly, which can prevent you from accessing important info later.</td>
        <td>Requires maintaining multiple aliases and possible setup for forwarding.If not well organized, it can be cumbersome to manage.</td>
