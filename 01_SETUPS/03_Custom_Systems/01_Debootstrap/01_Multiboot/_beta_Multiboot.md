  <h2>KVM-QEMU Limitations for GPU Passthrough with Windows</h2>

  <p><strong>KVM-QEMU</strong> is a robust virtualization tool but has specific
  limitations for GPU passthrough, particularly when running Windows:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Driver and Compatibility Issues:</strong> Windows drivers may
    face compatibility issues in a virtualized environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware Requirements:</strong> Proper IOMMU group configuration
    is needed, which can be complex and may lead to conflicts.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Constraints:</strong> There may be performance overhead
    compared to native OS setups, affecting high-performance applications.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resource Sharing Issues:</strong> Access conflicts can occur
    if the GPU is not correctly allocated, especially with multiple VMs
    or host needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Windows-Specific Constraints:</strong> Running Windows in a VM
    might trigger activation or licensing issues due to virtual environment
    detection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Linux Considerations:</strong></p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Kernel and Driver Support:</strong> Requires a Linux kernel with
    support for IOMMU and VFIO; older kernels might lack necessary features.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Configuration Complexity:</strong> Setting up KVM-QEMU with GPU
    passthrough involves detailed configuration and can be challenging.</li>
  </ul>
