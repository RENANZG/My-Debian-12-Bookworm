      An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a high-level programming language, without converting them into machine code.

      A compiler is a program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language into machine code. It is the computer’s responsibility to process the machine code.

     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Machine code storage</td>
     <td>
      The interpreter executes the code directly, so it does not store machine code. As there is no object code, memory management is simpler.
     </td>
     <td>
      The compiler generates and stores machine code on disk. Memory management is more complex because the object code takes up space.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Errors</td>
     <td>
      The interpreter executes code line by line and displays errors as they occur. This makes it faster to identify and fix errors, as the exact line causing the error is shown immediately.
     </td>
     <td>
      The compiler displays all errors only after completing the compilation process, showing them all at once. This can make it more challenging to identify and correct errors within the code.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Code Optimization</td>
     <td>
      The interpreter processes the code line by line. If there is an error, it must be resolved before moving to the next line, making optimization difficult.
     </td>
     <td>
      The compiler processes the entire code at once, allowing for easier optimization. Having access to the whole code enables various optimization techniques to improve performance.
